# Email Attachments from Upload Form

This Flask project creates a web form which can be used to upload files and send them as email attachments.

The upload functionality is based on a [blog post](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/handling-file-uploads-with-flask) by Miguel Grinberg.

## Installation

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:pentaquarx/email-uploaded-files.git
$ cd email-uploaded-files
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```console
$ flask run
```

Then, open a web browser and type `localhost:5000`.
